# genesis-code-0.1-

## Description

This webpage was preparation for an on-the-job ticket challenge in which I was provided with starter code. This source code had to be modified in order to be made cleaner and more legible for other devs to read.
My motivation for making this was to have a greater understanding of the intricacies within html and external css. It is the beginning of a learning process in the front end web dev scene for me and it seems like there's a worthwhile journey ahead of me.
One of the things which I found more challenging but grew to understand a bit more was how and when to use the div and section tags, especially as they have things in common. It was probably one of the more strenuous trial and error processes within this code but once I gained an understanding of it, cleaning up the code definitely became easier.

## Usage

The website is simple to navigate - if you click one of the links in the header bar then it will take you to the relevant paragraph in order to read about it. Also, if you hover above any of the images that aren't the background images, alt text appears in order to make the page more accessible.
